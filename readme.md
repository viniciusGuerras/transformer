## Transformer Model in PyTorch

This repository provides a basic implementation of a Transformer model in PyTorch, incorporating standard components like Multihead Attention, Positional Encoding, and a simple Feed-Forward Network. The model is designed to be easily understandable and customizable for various sequence-based tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP) and time series forecasting.

Features
	•	Multihead Attention: The model leverages multihead attention to capture dependencies across different parts of the input sequence.
	•	Positional Encoding: Since transformers do not have an inherent sense of sequence order, positional encoding is added to the input embeddings.
	•	Feed-Forward Networks: A simple feed-forward network with ReLU activation, following each attention layer.
	•	PyTorch-based: This implementation is built using PyTorch, which provides ease of use, scalability, and compatibility with modern deep learning tools.

Technologies
	•	PyTorch: For building and training the model.
	•	NumPy: For numerical operations (used in positional encoding).
	•	Pandas: For any potential data preprocessing or manipulation (though this example doesn’t directly use it for training).

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
	•	Python 3.x
	•	PyTorch
	•	NumPy
	•	Pandas (if needed for preprocessing)
