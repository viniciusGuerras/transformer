## Transformer Model in PyTorch

This repository provides a basic implementation of a Transformer model in PyTorch, incorporating standard components like Multihead Attention, Positional Encoding, and a simple Feed-Forward Network. The model is designed to be easily understandable and customizable for various sequence-based tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP) and time series forecasting.

Features
-   Multihead Attention: The model leverages multihead attention to capture dependencies across different parts of the input sequence.
-   Positional Encoding: Since transformers do not have an inherent sense of sequence order, positional encoding is added to the input embeddings.
-   Feed-Forward Networks: A simple feed-forward network with GeLU activation
-   Sparse Mix of Experts (MoE) architecture following the attention section
-   PyTorch-based: This implementation is built using PyTorch, which provides ease of use, scalability, and compatibility with modern deep learning tools.

Technologies
-   PyTorch: For building and training the model.
-   NumPy: For numerical operations 
-   Pandas: For data preprocessing or manipulation 

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
-   Python 3.x
-   PyTorch
-   NumPy
-   Pandas (if needed for preprocessing)
